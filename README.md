# topic-modeling-bertopic

## Project Summary:
1. I built a topic modeling system using BERTopic on the ArXiv dataset.
2. UMAP and HDBSCAN were used for dimensionality reduction and clustering respectively.
3. 161 distinct clusters were identified from ~40,000 research papers.
4. Representation models KeyBERT inspired and MMR were used to create topics for the 161 clusters.
