## Topic Representation Comparison

### Overview
We compared four different topic representation strategies on the same clustered documents to evaluate their effectiveness in generating interpretable and meaningful topic keywords.

### 1. Baseline: TF-IDF Representation
Traditional frequency-based approach that identifies keywords based on their importance within topics relative to the entire corpus.

| Topic | Keywords |
|-------|----------|
| **0 - Speech Processing** | speech \| asr \| recognition \| end \| acoustic |
| **1 - Medical NLP** | medical \| clinical \| biomedical \| patient \| health |
| **2 - Text Summarization** | summarization \| summaries \| summary \| abstractive \| document |
| **3 - Hate Speech Detection** | hate \| offensive \| speech \| detection \| toxic |
| **4 - Machine Translation** | translation \| nmt \| machine \| neural \| bleu |

### 2. KeyBERT-Inspired Representation
Selects keywords based on semantic similarity to the topic's centroid in embedding space, producing more semantically coherent keywords.

| Topic | Original Keywords | KeyBERT-Inspired Keywords | Improvement |
|-------|------------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| **0** | speech \| asr \| recognition \| end \| acoustic | speech \| transcription \| encoder \| phonetic \| acoustic | More specific technical terms |
| **1** | medical \| clinical \| biomedical \| patient \| health | nlp \| ehr \| ehrs \| clinical \| medicine | Domain-specific terminology (EHR) |
| **2** | summarization \| summaries \| summary \| abstractive \| document | summarization \| summarizers \| summaries \| summary \| abstractive | Better term consistency |
| **3** | hate \| offensive \| speech \| detection \| toxic | hate \| hateful \| language \| offensive \| classification | Clearer task framing |
| **4** | translation \| nmt \| machine \| neural \| bleu | translation \| translate \| translations \| multilingual \| machine | Broader translation aspects |

### 3. Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)
Balances relevance with diversity (diversity=0.5), preventing redundant keywords while maintaining topic coherence.

| Topic | Original Keywords | MMR Keywords | Diversity Benefit |
|-------|------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **0** | speech \| asr \| recognition \| end \| acoustic | speech \| asr \| error \| model \| automatic | Includes error handling & modeling |
| **1** | medical \| clinical \| biomedical \| patient \| health | clinical \| biomedical \| patient \| healthcare \| medical | Balanced medical terminology |
| **2** | summarization \| summaries \| summary \| abstractive \| document | summarization \| extractive \| factual \| document \| abstractive | Covers both paradigms |
| **3** | hate \| offensive \| speech \| detection \| toxic | hate \| toxic \| abusive \| platforms \| dataset | Broader problem scope |
| **4** | translation \| nmt \| machine \| neural \| bleu | nmt \| bleu \| multilingual \| parallel \| source | Technical diversity |

### 4. Generative AI (Flan-T5)
Uses language model to generate natural language descriptions of topics based on constituent documents.

| Topic | Original Keywords | Generative Description | Analysis |
|-------|------------------|------------------------|----------|
| **0** | speech \| asr \| recognition \| end \| acoustic | Speech-to-speech | Concise, high-level description |
| **1** | medical \| clinical \| biomedical \| patient \| health | Science/Tech | Too generic, needs refinement |
| **2** | summarization \| summaries \| summary \| abstractive \| document | Abstractive summarization | Accurate technical term |
| **3** | hate \| offensive \| speech \| detection \| toxic | Science/Tech | Insufficient specificity |
| **4** | translation \| nmt \| machine \| neural \| bleu | Science/Tech | Requires better prompting |

**Key Finding**: While generative models show promise for creating human-readable descriptions, they require careful prompt engineering. The model successfully identified specific topics (Speech-to-speech, Abstractive summarization) but defaulted to generic labels for others.

## Visualization Analysis

### Figure 1: Document Clustering in 2D Space
![Document Clusters](results/figures/documents_and_topics.png)

**Key Observations:**
- **Clear Topic Separation**: Documents form distinct clusters with minimal overlap, validating our clustering approach
- **Major Research Areas**: 
  - Large orange cluster (bottom-left): Core NLP tasks (translation, summarization)
  - Green cluster (top): Speech and audio processing
  - Blue clusters (right): Specialized domains (medical, legal NLP)
- **Topic Labels**: The 24 most prominent topics are clearly labeled, representing the major research directions in NLP
- **Density Patterns**: Denser regions indicate more active research areas, with speech recognition and machine translation showing highest concentration

**Technical Achievement**: Successfully reduced 384-dimensional embeddings to 2D while preserving semantic relationships, enabling intuitive visualization of the research landscape.

### Figure 2: Hierarchical Topic Structure
![Topic Hierarchy](results/figures/hierarchy.png)

**Hierarchical Insights:**
1. **Top-Level Branches** (Major Research Domains):
   - **Branch 1 (Blue)**: Core NLP tasks - translation, parsing, language modeling
   - **Branch 2 (Green)**: Applied NLP - medical, legal, educational applications  
   - **Branch 3 (Red)**: Speech and multimodal - ASR, vision-language, audio processing
   - **Branch 4 (Purple)**: Specialized techniques - adversarial methods, privacy, fairness

2. **Clustering Distance** (X-axis: 0.2 to 1.4):
   - Topics merging at **<0.4**: Very similar (e.g., different aspects of same problem)
   - Topics merging at **0.4-0.8**: Related fields (e.g., all biomedical NLP variants)
   - Topics merging at **>0.8**: Distinct research areas

3. **Notable Relationships**:
   - Topics 11 (legal) and 64 (contracts) cluster early - clear subdomain relationship
   - Topics 0 (speech) and 135 (ASR variants) form coherent speech processing branch
   - Translation topics (4, 16, 108) group together despite methodological differences

**Research Implications**: The hierarchy reveals how NLP research naturally organizes into subfields, with clear boundaries between application domains but shared methodological foundations.
